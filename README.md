#Process and Goals
The goal was to make a website and pool in all of my knowledge and experience from creating small and simple apps, I wanted to fully learn the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails, Coming from a node background, It was fun, frustrating, and an enjoyable experience, And I still want to learn more.


#Overall Result:
Through out the project I've learned how to use erb templating, ajax remote calls to the server, SCSS. I've also implemented a basic contact form mailer using mail_form with send_grid to send the email and simple_form to add a minimal form style. And a dash of jQuery magic to get the animations going. I still prefer to learn more Javascript, to loose some dependency on jQuery.
